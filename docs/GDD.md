# 1620
## Game Design Document v0.1

## Elevator Pitch

"The Revenant meets Rust, set during first contact. Play as colonist or native. Survive the wilderness. Survive each other. History remembers the winners."

**Tagline options:**
- "History remembers the winners."
- "Two peoples. One land. No mercy."
- "Before America, there was survival."

---

## Core Concept

A 3D survival MMO set in early 1600s colonial America. Two playable factions - European settlers and Native American nations - compete for resources, territory, and survival in a brutal, historically-grounded open world.

**Tone:** The Revenant (2015) - visceral, grounded, beautiful, unforgiving

**Setting:** Northeastern America, 1620s - Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, and surrounding wilderness

---

## Design Pillars

1. **Survival is brutal** - Cold, hunger, disease, injuries that linger
2. **Every life matters** - Permadeath or harsh death penalties, no respawn spam
3. **Two truths** - Both factions are playable, both have valid perspectives
4. **History as gameplay** - Real events, real tensions, real consequences
5. **The land is a character** - Seasons, weather, wildlife shape everything

---

## Factions

### Faction Balance: Rock-Paper-Scissors

Each faction excels in one domain, creating natural interdependence and trade opportunities:

| Faction | Specialty | Advantage | Weakness |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Native Nations** | Land & Resources | Hunting, foraging, medicine, tracking | Limited metal tools, no firearms (early) |
| **American Settlers** | Weapons & Industry | Firearms, metal tools, fortifications | Can't navigate, starve without help |
| **French-Canadians** | Waterways & Trade | Fast travel, trade networks, diplomacy | Can't hold territory, small numbers |

**The triangle:**
```
            NATIVES
           (Resources)
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /      \
          /        \
    FRENCH ──────── AMERICAN
   (Travel)        (Weapons)
```

- **Natives** need French trade goods and eventually American metal
- **Americans** need Native knowledge to survive and French routes to expand
- **French** need Native pelts to trade and American markets to sell to

No faction can dominate alone. Alliances shift. History happens.

---

### The Wampanoag Confederacy (Native Nations)

**Fantasy:** Live as your ancestors did. Protect your homeland. Witness the beginning of the end.

**Strengths:**
- Deep knowledge of the land (tracking, foraging, hunting bonuses)
- Established settlements and trade routes
- Spiritual mechanics (vision quests, animal totems)
- Superior mobility (canoes, forest navigation)
- Alliance network with other tribes

**Weaknesses:**
- No immunity to European diseases
- Limited access to metal tools/firearms (early game)
- Outnumbered as more ships arrive

**Gameplay loop:**
- Hunt, fish, farm (three sisters: corn, beans, squash)
- Protect sacred sites and hunting grounds
- Trade or raid settler camps
- Diplomatic missions to other tribes
- Rituals and ceremonies for buffs/progression

---

### Plymouth Colony (European Settlers)

**Fantasy:** Survive in a new world. Build a future. But at what cost?

**Strengths:**
- Firearms (slow, loud, deadly)
- Metal tools (axes, saws, nails)
- Ships bring reinforcements and supplies
- Fortification knowledge
- Written communication (letters, maps)

**Weaknesses:**
- No knowledge of the land (starving times)
- Disease cuts both ways (scurvy, harsh winters)
- Dependent on supply ships
- Internal religious/political conflict

**Gameplay loop:**
- Chop wood, build shelter, farm European crops
- Hunt unfamiliar animals
- Trade with or fight natives
- Expand territory, build fortifications
- Wait for (or signal) supply ships

---

### French-Canadian Traders (Third Faction / NPC)

**Fantasy:** Masters of the wilderness. You've been here for generations. The land is your highway.

**Available:** Unlocked in later eras (1700+) or as NPCs in 1620

**Strengths:**
- Expert wilderness navigation (canoes, river networks)
- Established Native alliances through intermarriage
- Best fur trading knowledge and routes
- Bilingual (French + Native languages)
- Can move freely between factions

**Weaknesses:**
- No territorial claims (traders, not settlers)
- Caught between empires (British, French, American)
- Small population, can't hold ground
- Dependent on beaver economy

**Gameplay loop:**
- Paddle river networks for speed
- Trade with all factions (profit from conflict)
- Run trading posts in neutral territory
- Hire out as guides
- Build Métis communities (mixed culture)

**Unique mechanics:**
- **River mastery:** Canoe travel 3x faster than walking
- **Reputation with all factions:** Can be friendly with natives AND settlers
- **Trading post economy:** Set up shops, profit from others' survival needs
- **Métis identity:** Children inherit mixed bonuses

**Historical note:**
French-Canadians controlled the interior of North America via waterways while British colonists were stuck behind the Appalachians. A voyageur could paddle from Montreal to Montana. By 1820 (The Revenant era), they were the most experienced wilderness operators but caught between the American expansion and their fading empire.

## Geography: The Shape of the Continent

Understanding the land is key to understanding the conflict.

### The Zones

| Zone | Description | 1620 | 1820 |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Atlantic Coast** | Where ships land | Plymouth colony | Major cities (200 yrs old) |
| **Coastal Farmland** | 50-100 miles inland | Wilderness | Settled farms, roads |
| **Appalachian Mountains** | Natural wall | Impassable barrier | Sparse mountain folk |
| **Ohio Valley** | Beyond the mountains | Native territory | New settlements |
| **Mississippi River** | The great highway | French traders | Edge of civilization |
| **Great Plains** | Buffalo country | Native homeland | Fur trapper territory |
| **Rocky Mountains** | Continental divide | Unknown | Barely explored |

### The French Waterway Network

The French understood something the British didn't: **rivers are highways**.

```
Montreal
    ↓
St. Lawrence River
    ↓
Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron)
    ↓
Portage routes (carry canoes between rivers)
    ↓
Mississippi River tributaries
    ↓
All the way to New Orleans (or west to Montana)
```

**Gameplay implication:** Controlling rivers = controlling trade. French-Canadian players/NPCs use this network to move faster and access areas others can't reach easily.

### Distance Reality

The scale of North America shocked Europeans:

| Journey | Distance | 1820 Travel Time |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Boston → Philadelphia | 300 miles | 3-5 days (road) |
| Philadelphia → Pittsburgh | 300 miles | 1-2 weeks (mountain crossing) |
| St. Louis → Montana | 1,500 miles | 3-6 months (river/overland) |
| Montreal → New Orleans | 2,000 miles | 2-3 months (river) |

The Revenant takes place **months** of travel from any city. You are truly alone.

### Map Progression (Full Game)

| Era | Playable Region | New Zones |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| **1620** | Massachusetts Bay (Plymouth) | Coastal forest, native villages |
| **1700** | Expand to New York, Pennsylvania | Appalachian foothills, river valleys |
| **1750** | Ohio Valley opens | French forts, Great Lakes access |
| **1800** | Louisiana Purchase | Mississippi River, Great Plains edge |
| **1820** | Full frontier (demo content) | Montana, Rockies, Revenant territory |

---

## Core Systems

### Survival

| Need | Mechanic |
|------|----------|
| Hunger | Hunt, fish, forage, farm. Different foods have different nutrition. Seasons affect availability. |
| Thirst | Fresh water sources. Boiling prevents disease. Alcohol trades nutrition for warmth. |
| Temperature | Clothing, fire, shelter. Hypothermia in winter. Heatstroke in summer. |
| Health | Injuries persist. Broken bones, infections, bleeding. Medicine is scarce. |
| Disease | Smallpox, flu devastate natives. Scurvy, dysentery hit settlers. Quarantine mechanics. |

### Combat

**Inspired by:** The Revenant's visceral, desperate fights

- **Melee:** Tomahawks, knives, clubs, hatchets. Stamina-based. Grappling.
- **Ranged (Native):** Bows - silent, fast, moderate damage. Skill-based aiming.
- **Ranged (Settler):** Muskets - loud, slow reload (20-30 seconds), devastating damage. Alerts everyone nearby.
- **Injuries:** Wounds affect performance. Arrow in leg = limping. Cut arm = weak swings.
- **Executions:** Downed players can be finished or captured.

### Crafting

**Native crafting:**
- Birch bark canoes
- Leather clothing, moccasins
- Bows, arrows (different tips for different prey)
- Wampum (currency/diplomacy)
- Medicine from plants
- Wigwams, longhouses

**Settler crafting:**
- Log cabins, palisades
- Muskets, powder, shot (complex, many components)
- Metal tools (requires forge, fuel, ore)
- Preserved foods (salting, smoking)
- Clothing (wool, linen)

### Seasons

| Season | Effects |
|--------|---------|
| Spring | Rivers flood, planting season, animals return, mud slows travel |
| Summer | Peak hunting, farming, long days, heat exhaustion risk |
| Fall | Harvest, animal migrations, preparation time, best trading |
| Winter | Starvation risk, hypothermia, limited hunting, reduced conflict |

---

## World Design

### Starting Zones

**Native players:** Start in established village. Tutorial covers hunting, crafting, spirituality. Learn the land is sacred.

**Settler players:** Arrive by ship. Tutorial is the starving time. Learn desperation, dependence.

### Key Locations

- **Plymouth Rock** - Settler landing point, early settlement
- **Patuxet** - Wampanoag village (Squanto's home)
- **Trading posts** - Neutral ground, tense exchanges
- **Sacred groves** - Native ritual sites, spiritual power
- **Deep wilderness** - Revenant territory, fur trapping, extreme survival

### Map Progression

Launch: Massachusetts Bay area (~50 sq km)
Expansion 1: Connecticut, Rhode Island
Expansion 2: New York (Dutch conflict)
Expansion 3: Push west toward Great Lakes / fur trade territory (Revenant country)

---

## Narrative Framework

### No single story - emergent history

The game doesn't tell you who's right. It shows you what happened and lets players live it.

### Historical events as world events

- **1620:** Mayflower arrives (game launch)
- **1621:** First Thanksgiving (seasonal event - cooperation or trap?)
- **1622:** Wessagusset colony conflict
- **1630:** Great Migration begins (more settlers = power shift)
- **1636:** Pequot War (if timeline extends)

### Personal stories

- Settlers who defect and join tribes (historically real)
- Natives who learn English, serve as translators
- Mixed relationships, mixed loyalties
- Revenge arcs (your village was burned, your family died of smallpox)

---

## Monetization

### NOT pay-to-win

**Model:** Buy-to-play + cosmetic shop + expansions

- Base game: $40
- Cosmetics: Historically-accurate clothing variants, canoe designs, weapon skins
- Expansions: New regions, new tribes, new colonial powers (Dutch, French, Spanish)

### NO:
- Gameplay advantages for money
- Loot boxes
- Pay-to-skip survival

---

## Technical Scope

### Engine: Unreal Engine 5 or Godot 4 (evaluate)

**UE5 pros:** Nanite, Lumen, marketplace assets, industry standard
**Godot pros:** Free, you know it, lightweight servers

### Server Architecture

- Dedicated servers (50-100 players per world)
- Persistent world (your cabin stays when you log off)
- Server clusters by region/era

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. One small region (10 sq km)
2. Both factions playable
3. Core survival loop
4. Basic combat (melee + bows + one firearm)
5. Basic crafting (shelter, tools, weapons)
6. One season (fall)
7. 20-30 concurrent players

---

## 1820 Demo: "The Ambush"

### Why Start with 1820?

The full game spans 1620-1820, but we build the **demo in 1820 first**:

1. **Proven appeal** - The Revenant (2015) is the direct reference, audiences know this era
2. **Balanced factions** - Both sides have firearms, horses, 200 years of adaptation
3. **Simpler pitch** - "The Revenant meets Rust" is instantly understood
4. **Smart dev order** - 1820 content becomes endgame; 1620 is built by *removing* tech, not adding

### The Scene: Arikara Ambush

Recreate The Revenant's opening: a fur trapper camp on the Upper Missouri River is ambushed at dawn.

**Setting:**
- Missouri River, South Dakota/Montana territory, 1823
- Dense forest, river, morning fog
- Trapper camp: tents, pelts, canoes, fire pits

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes of gameplay

**Playable perspectives:**
| Trapper (Defend) | Arikara Warrior (Attack) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Survive the ambush | Execute the raid |
| Grab rifle, defend camp | Silent approach, then chaos |
| Flee to the river | Cut off escape routes |
| Escape into wilderness | Recover stolen goods/captives |

### What the Demo Showcases

| System | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Movement | Weighty third-person, stamina, terrain navigation |
| Melee combat | Tomahawks, knives, grappling, executions |
| Ranged (Native) | Bows - silent, fast, skill-based aiming |
| Ranged (Settler) | Flintlock rifles - loud, slow reload (20-30s), devastating |
| Injuries | Arrow wounds slow movement, blood trail, limping |
| Environment | River, forest, fog, dynamic lighting |
| Audio | Gunshots echo, arrows thud, screams, river ambience |
| AI | Basic enemy/ally combat behavior |

### What the Demo DOESN'T Need

- Full survival systems (hunger, thirst, temperature)
- Crafting
- Building
- Seasons/weather progression
- Persistent world
- Multiplayer (single-player demo is fine for pitch)

### Technical Approach

**Engine:** Unity (Invector controller) or Unreal Engine 5

**Development order:**
1. **Graybox** (1-2 days) - Block out river, treeline, camp with primitives
2. **Core combat** (2-3 weeks) - Movement, melee, bow, rifle
3. **Environment art** (2 weeks) - Asset store forest, river, fog
4. **Characters** (1-2 weeks) - Trappers, warriors, basic animations
5. **Audio + polish** (1 week) - Sound design sells the immersion
6. **AI** (1 week) - Basic attack/defend behaviors

**Estimated timeline:** 6-8 weeks focused development

**Asset store acceleration:**
- Invector Melee Combat Template (~$60)
- NatureManufacture forests/rivers (~$50-100)
- Master Archer bow system (~$30)
- Character base models (Mixamo free or asset store)

### Connection to Full Game

The 1820 demo becomes the **endgame content** in the full release:

```
Full Game Timeline:

1620 ──────────────────────────────────────► 1820
[Start]                                    [Endgame/Demo]

- Matchlock muskets → Flintlock rifles
- No horses → Mounted combat
- First contact → 200 years of conflict
- Simple tech → Advanced crafting
- Pilgrim colonies → Frontier wilderness
```

**Progression unlocks history:**
- Server starts in 1620
- Historical events advance the era
- Tech trees unlock over time
- Players experience colonization in real-time
- Demo content is what everyone works *toward*

---

## 1820 Faction Tech

By 1820, the tech gap has mostly closed. The difference is *how* each faction uses it.

### Native Nations (Plains/Frontier Tribes)

| Category | Tech | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Transport** | Horses | Game-changer. Plains tribes = best cavalry in the world |
| **Ranged** | Bows (primary), some trade rifles | Bows preferred: silent, 10 arrows/min vs 2 shots/min |
| **Melee** | Tomahawks, war clubs, lances | Deadly, especially mounted |
| **Armor** | Buffalo hide shields | Could deflect arrows, sometimes bullets |
| **Shelter** | Tipis | Mobile, follows buffalo herds |
| **Medicine** | Herbal, spiritual | Often more effective than American "medicine" |
| **Clothing** | Buckskin, buffalo robes | Perfectly adapted to environment |
| **Food** | Pemmican, dried meat | Stores for months, travel light |

**Edge:** Mobility, land knowledge, mounted combat, sustainable living

---

### American Trappers/Frontiersmen

| Category | Tech | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Transport** | Horses, mules | Less skilled riders than natives |
| **Ranged** | Flintlock rifles (Hawken, Kentucky) | Accurate to 200+ yards, slow reload |
| **Sidearm** | Flintlock pistols | One shot, then it's a club |
| **Melee** | Bowie knife, hatchet | Adopted tomahawk from natives |
| **Trapping** | Steel leg traps | The whole reason they're out there |
| **Shelter** | Canvas tents, lean-tos | Temporary camps |
| **Medicine** | Whiskey and prayer | Honestly terrible |
| **Clothing** | Buckskin (copied natives) | Abandoned wool pretty quick |
| **Industry** | Gunpowder, lead shot, metal repair | Can maintain firearms |

**Edge:** Firepower, metal tools, connection to Eastern supply chain

#### Who Became a Mountain Man?

The trappers weren't soldiers or settlers - they were **desperate men seeking fortune or escape**.

**Recruitment:**
- Companies recruited at taverns in St. Louis
- Promised wealth: $1,000-2,000/year (vs $200-300 for laborers)
- Many signed contracts they didn't understand
- Debt traps: company sold supplies at 500% markup, you owed them forever

**The men who signed up:**

| Type | Why They Came |
|------|---------------|
| **Debtors** | Escape creditors - no law out there |
| **Criminals** | Wanted men fleeing justice |
| **Adventurers** | Couldn't stand "civilization" |
| **Immigrants** | No land in the East, seek fortune |
| **Veterans** | After War of 1812, nothing else |
| **Misfits** | Didn't fit in settled society |

**The brutal reality:**
- 1 in 3 died within 5 years (natives, bears, cold, accidents, disease)
- No way home - 6 months travel from civilization
- If you survived 5-10 years, you might come out rich. Most didn't.
- Average "career" was 3-5 years before death, injury, or giving up

**Hugh Glass (The Revenant) was typical:**
- Possibly a former pirate
- Joined Ashley-Henry expedition for money
- Nearly died multiple times
- Kept going back anyway

**Gameplay implication:** American trappers aren't heroes - they're desperate, dangerous men. Some are honorable, some are criminals. Player choice matters.

### French-Canadian Voyageurs

| Category | Tech | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Transport** | Birch bark canoes, horses | Canoe is their secret weapon |
| **Ranged** | Trade muskets, rifles | Similar to Americans |
| **Melee** | Knives, hatchets | |
| **Trade goods** | Blankets, beads, metal tools, alcohol, gunpowder | Currency of the frontier |
| **Shelter** | Trading posts, winter camps | Semi-permanent infrastructure |
| **Medicine** | Mix of European and Native knowledge | Better than Americans |
| **Clothing** | Hybrid French-Native style | Capotes, moccasins, sashes |
| **Navigation** | Maps, river knowledge | Could cross the continent |

**Edge:** Mobility via water, trade networks, diplomacy with all sides

---

### The Edge: Where the Game Takes Place

The game is set at the frontier's edge - minimal establishment, maximum conflict.

```
THE EDGE (Game Setting)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Civilization]        [The Edge]           [Deep Wilderness]
   St. Louis ←————————→ Trading Post ←————————→ Uncharted
                            ↑
                       YOUR GAME

- One trading post (neutral ground)
- Scattered trapper camps
- Native villages
- Contested hunting grounds
- No law, no reinforcements
```

### What Each Faction Brings

| Faction | Brings | Wants | Controls |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Natives** | Pelts, food, guides, land knowledge | Metal, guns, trade goods | Hunting grounds, sacred sites |
| **Americans** | Guns, powder, metal traps, Eastern goods | Pelts, survival knowledge | Trapping territories |
| **French** | Trade goods, river routes, diplomacy | Pelts from both sides | Trading posts, waterways |

### Conflict Drivers

- **Beaver pelts** - the oil of 1820, worth killing for
- **Territorial hunting rights** - overlapping claims
- **Trading post control** - whoever controls trade controls the region
- **Revenge cycles** - raid begets raid
- **Disease outbreaks** - blame and fear
- **Supply line disruption** - starve your enemies

---

### Ownership vs Reality: The Legal Fiction

America "bought" Louisiana in 1803. But what does ownership mean when you can't enforce it?

**The absurdity of the Louisiana Purchase:**

| Who "Owned" Louisiana? | Their Claim |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **France** | "We claimed it 150 years ago" |
| **Spain** | "France gave it to us, then took it back" |
| **America** | "We bought it from France for $15M" |
| **Native Nations** | "We've LIVED here for 10,000 years" |
| **Nobody asked the natives** | ← The point |

**On paper vs On the ground:**

```
ON PAPER (Paris, 1803):              ON THE GROUND (Montana, 1820):
─────────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────
"America owns 828,000 sq miles"      Lakota: "You own WHAT now?"
                                     Arikara: "Nobody told us"
                                     French trader: "Been here 50 years"
                                     Grizzly bear: *doesn't care*
```

**What America actually controlled in 1820:**

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↑
        St. Louis (edge of actual American control)
```

**What "ownership" actually meant:**

| What America Got | What America Didn't Get |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Right to negotiate (not France) | Actual control |
| Right to trade | Safe passage |
| Right to exclude European powers | Native compliance |
| Future settlement claims | Current settlement |
| Mississippi River shipping | Anything west of it |

**The French-Canadian situation:**

France sold the *government claim*, not the people:
- French-Canadian traders stayed and kept working
- Many had native wives, mixed-blood children, no national loyalty
- "I was here before America existed"
- They just traded with whoever paid

**The trapper's reality:**

```
Legal:    "This is United States soil"
Actual:   "The Arikara control this river"
          "The Lakota control those plains"
          "The French control that trading post"
          "You control your campfire. Maybe."
```

**Gameplay implication:**

This is **anarchy with commerce**:
- No faction is "in charge"
- Treaties mean nothing without force to back them
- The trading post is neutral because everyone needs it
- Violence is localized - no cavalry coming to rescue
- Everyone operates in a legal fiction layered on brutal reality

**Why this makes 1820 perfect for the game:**
- Old native power isn't broken yet
- American expansion hasn't arrived in force
- French traders profit from the chaos
- Everyone competes in the power vacuum
- History is up for grabs

## Open Questions

- [ ] Permadeath or harsh respawn penalty?
- [ ] How do ships/reinforcements work? (Queue system? Scheduled arrivals?)
- [ ] PvP always on or flagging system?
- [ ] How to handle the "everyone plays native to win" balance issue?
- [ ] What happens when settlers "win" a server? Reset? New map?
- [ ] Specific tribe partnerships for cultural consultation?

## Personal Connection

Developer's grandparents served on a Native American reservation in Nebraska. This game is partly a tribute to that experience and a desire to tell this story with respect and authenticity.

The goal is not to exploit history but to let players experience it from both sides - and understand what was gained and lost.
